# Project 1 to-do list:

Hello! My name is William Grahl and I am at the moment studying back-end programming.
This is my first ever project and I have spent roughfly 30 hours on this project.
I had very much fun making this and it was very challangeing, but here we are with a fully functionizing to-do list that i have made on my own!

The to-do list works like this.
You open the list and it says My to do list and then it asks if you want to add, delete or move something in my list or if i want to access other stuff.
So that tells you that it can add delete and move but now what is in the other categori?
In other we have search, set priorities by the colours of red(high), yellow(medium) and green(low) priorities followed by sort by priorities and lastly the edit function. The edit function allows you to edit the item in the list and also change the priority.
Last but not least I have made it possible to save your list so that next time you enter the program its still there.

This is like I said before my first project, I have more ideas to add to this so we'll see if that happens in the future but for now this is the final version.

Thank you!
